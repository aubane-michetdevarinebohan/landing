			<h2> About the founder </h2>
			<img class="avatar" src="images/aubane.jpeg" alt="Aubane de Varine">
			<p>
				Aubane de Varine is currently finishing her master 1 in Entrepreneurship and Innovation at I√âSEG. She decided to do a brand creation project instead of a thesis for the end of the master.
				"I decided to create a post-operative lingerie brand for women that suffered of a breast cancer. While working for an underwear company, I noticed how frustrated these women were when looking at the ensembles that were sexy and diversified. I strongly believe that every women needs to wear the lingerie that will make her self-confident and strong to face life's challenges."
